This port compiles the ocaml byte-code compiler to work as a noux
process on Genode.  It does not yet support the native-code compiler.

Note that the port uses the cross-compilation support in the ocaml
build, which requires the host to already have the exact same version
of the compiler as the version in this port.

A test run script that only does the build (but does not yet execute
the built compiler on Genode) is provided. To use it to build:

$ make run/ocaml_test

(Sometimes if the build fails in the configure step, repeating the
 command with VERBOSE= flags gets the build to go through.)

$ make VERBOSE= run/ocaml_test
